// Description:
/*
    Facilities to do file things.
    Is a manager, and a single file object.
    Is specific to audio world, it will tell you what kind of (audio) file is inside.

    Use Cases:
      A small file is read in completely to a stream image.
      A small file is written completely from a stream image.
      A large file is read in piece-meal.  String-of-pearl like.  and each pearl is discarded after the musician is done.
        An analyzer will do this to provide a summary analysis or shuttle through for views.
      A large file is randomly read, with an arbitrarily sized, located block.
        An analyzer will do this to shuttle through a viewport of it.  SpecAn, Scope, Song Looping.
      All of these are managed by the RiffMgr system.  We don't need residency, start/stop, number types etc.
    Attributes:
      File Control I/F -
        public:
          File Name
          File Size (in bytes)
          File Type (r, w, rw, b, t)
          File State (enum) GetState() {idle, open, closed, non-existant, isDir, inaccessible} some conflation
          Open (locking, no-locking)
          Close()
          Fetch (n bytes from p location)
          Overwrite (n bytes to p location)
          Append (n bytes)
          <callback>Done Working, so the AudioFile object has new information.
        private:
          fd, the ancient posix file descriptor number.
      DOESN't know what the type or organization of the data is.
    Functions:
      Is able to get a contiguous block of num bytes starting at offset and report if it is legal to do so.
    Relationships:
      This object only knows about the header of the audio file formats that it will try to work with.
      It doesn't have any more smarts that.
      Ultimately, the higher levels will need to have their various format types know how to handle files based on headers.
